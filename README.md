# Final-Year-project
Model used for analysis in my Final Year
In this paper, numerical solutions for a system of differential equation by using the Euler, 
Bogacki-Shampine and Adams-Bashforth-Moulton methods are presented. The convergences of 
these methods have been discussed with an example which was presented to show the ability of 
the methods for linear systems of differential equations. The results obtained are in good 
agreement with the exact solution. These results show that the techniques used here are accurate 
and easy to apply. The convergence of the methods under consideration and results obtained 
were compared to the exact solution. The error incurred is undertaken to determine the accuracy of the method.
